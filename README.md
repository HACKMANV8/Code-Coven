SafeLink: Web-Activated Smart Jewelry Safety Device
SafeLink transforms any desktop or mobile browser into the control center for a discreet, intelligent personal safety system inspired by smart wearable devices. Instead of a physical sensor, the solution uses your web app’s interface to listen for activation triggers—like double taps, voice commands, or button presses—to deliver reliable, silent protection.

How It Works
SafeLink blends style and security as a digital counterpart to a wearable ring, bracelet, or pendant. When the user performs a subtle activation gesture (such as a double tap or a voice command in the app), the system vibrates or visually confirms that an alert is being prepared. On confirmation, SafeLink immediately captures the user’s real-time location and notifies emergency contacts, while an automated voice call to the nearest helpline shares the location details.

To prevent false alarms, SafeLink offers a “soft alert” mode: a discreet check-in notification sent to contacts if the situation is uncertain. If the user does not confirm their safety within a short window, SafeLink escalates to a full emergency alert.

Key features include:

Discrete Activation: Double tap or voice-initiated triggers for alerts.

Confirm Feedback: Vibration/visual cue and second gesture required for confirmation.

Location Sharing: Instantly sends real-time location to trusted contacts and emergency services.

Soft Alert Escalation: Sends an initial check-in and upgrades to emergency if unsafe.

Automated Calls: Automatically dials local helplines spreading key info.

User-Friendly Web Control: No external device required—just use the web app as your safety dashboard.

This approach ensures user safety is always one gesture away—anytime, anywhere—while minimizing accidental activations. SafeLink’s intelligent escalation, reassurance feedback, and real-time alerting makes it the perfect modern solution for empowering safety with convenience and style.
